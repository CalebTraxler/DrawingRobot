# DrawingRobot
Developed a drawing robot using MATLAB and SIMULINK, which replicates images on whiteboards via advanced image processing and applied physics. Expert in MATLAB, integrated with Arduino for precise robotic control, demonstrating skill in software-hardware interfacing and engineering applications.

Note that I was able to save the mlx files from MATLAB as PDF's. 

Note that I will be posting specific details, results and ideas later in a later time. 

This is only the templates that helped me with the project.
